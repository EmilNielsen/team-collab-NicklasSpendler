No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"\r\n\r\nAfsnit 1.10.33 fra \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", skrevet af Cicero i 45 f.kr.\r\n\"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"'),

Unreal and Source Engine games ran like butter on most PCs, but only because they hadn\'t changed much since the Xbox 360 and PS3 releases around 2005.  \r\n\r\nCrysis asked so much of us that over the years it imprinted on the minds of a generation and ascended into a higher form of collective thought.\'But can it run Crysis?\'\r\n\r\nA meme was born, a slimy, bawling thing that dominated message board conversations and comments sections. But does it still live 10 years on? \r\n\r\n2007 \r\nThe AGP era of graphics cards was giving way to the new PCI Express, and Nvidia\'s GeForce 8800 GTX was the reigning King of Graphics, thanks to a staggering 768MB of RAM and 128 stream processors clocked at over 1GHz. A new generation of cards were just a few months away, and when Crysis arrived in November, its graphical potential represented a desire to move on. With the Xbox 360 released in 2005 and PS3 shortly after in 2006, videogame graphics were stuck in the mud while PC hardware kept improving rapidly. Games made exclusively for the PC were a huge risk in a console-focused market, let alone any that required $2000 PCs to play. \r\n\r\nBut then Crysis came out looking like it did, and famished as they were, PC players flocked to it like ragdoll moths to a flame with advanced post-processing effects. It was a glimpse of the future of guns and jungulature as interpreted by screen space ambient occlusion, a common lighting shader that debuted in Crysis before anywhere else. And adding to the mystique (and the difficulty of running it), the highest settings were locked away behind the brand new DirectX 10 and Windows Vista, released that year.\r\n\r\nMeme culture was blowing up at the same time. 2007 was one of the most prolific years for viral internet jokes, delivering Chocolate Rain, Rick-rolling, turtles, and fellow videogame catchphrase, \"The cake is a lie.\" \r\n\r\nBorne from a genuine question, bolstered by the absurd requirements to answer it, and fueled by the excitement over a new PC game that finally summoned the skills of hardware enthusiasts, \"But can it run Crysis\" started gathering momentum and wouldn\'t stop rolling anytime soon.\r\n\r\n2009 \r\nThese were the golden days. The meme business was booming under the umbrella of classics like \'David after dentist\' and the three-wolf moon t-shirt. In the videogame sector, \'But can it run Crysis\' was on top of the world. Only the most expensive machines could run the damn thing. Everyone knew someone who played on max settings, even if their PC could only run Crysis at 12 frames per second. We were all miserable, and we loved it. '),

I rejected their offer before we had a chance to talk about money.\" \r\n\r\nDarq came out on Steam this week, and Marhulets said he\'ll \"probably\" make less money selling through Steam than he would if he had accepted Epic\'s deal, which included a minimum revenue guarantee. The idea of \"getting some upfront payment on top of guaranteed revenue sounds great\", but he didn\'t want to break a promise to players who expected to buy the game on Steam, he said. \r\n\r\n\"Turning down the Epic exclusivity offer might have been a foolish decision in the short term, considering the amount of money that might have been involved. When thinking long term, however, this was an easy and obvious decision to make (in my case).\r\n\r\n\"Pulling the game off Steam a few days after Steam release date announcement would forever ruin the credibility of my studio. I would like for my customers to have confidence that my word means something, especially when making announcement as crucial as release date/platform.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to give players as many options as possible, he said: he\'s also selling the game through GOG, for example. \"I wish the Epic Store would allow indie games to be sold there non-exclusively, as they do with larger, still unreleased games (Cyberpunk 2077), so players can enjoy what they want: a choice.\"\r\n\r\nMarhulets stressed that \"he\'s not speaking on behalf of other developers\", and that for some studios accepting an Epic exclusivity deal might be the best plan long-term. \"Every indie studio has a unique story and has to deal with a unique set of obstacles. The reasons are mine and mine only. Rejecting such offer happened to be right for my game, but might not be right for other games/studios, as their goals and long-term plans might differ from mine.\"\r\n\r\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney commented on the case on Twitter after Mark Kern, team lead for vanilla World of Warcraft, said it was \"not right\" for Epic to disqualify Darq from the Epic Games Store just because they turned down an exclusivity offer.'),

It will also add new base-building options, and good luck to them because it\'s going to be hard to follow \'build a base on the back of a giant sea turtle.\' I\'ve been wanting to do that in a video game ever since I saw the Lion Turtle in Avatar: The Last Airbender. \r\n\r\nLast year, we took a deep dive into a secret war that\'s been dominating Ark: Survival Evolved for over two years. \r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT ARK: SURVIVAL EVOLVED'),

My brain already loves to put me through the wringer with restless dreams, so I was worried that Darq’s subject matter might be too much for me. But its somber monochromatic visuals and puzzles that bend the laws of physics were too alluring of a sirensong, and I’m glad they pulled me to play it because, even at its most bleak, Darq is beautiful.\r\n\r\nDarq fixates on submerging you in a dreamscape and doesn\'t elaborate much in the way of a backstory. There\'s no initial title screen, even; instead, a decaying apartment with a boy quivering at the center. This is Darq\'s protagonist, Lloyd. He\'s at the mercy of his unconscious mind, desperate to wake up - but I only know even those few details from perusing Darq\'s official website. The story is intentionally opaque to replicate that \"fuzzy details\" feeling when you try to recall a dream from memory - more thoughts and feelings, less plot and exposition - which works in its favor.\r\nMost of my enjoyment of the story came from theorizing with others about what it all meant, the kind of mystery that fuels a good water cooler chat. While that ambiguity might not appeal to everyone, I loved internalizing each chapter; processing and speculating on the meaning behind them. For example, while analyzing the set-dressing on one level, I noticed there was a recurring motif of physical illness. An intensive care unit (ICU) can be heard beeping away periodically in the background, while several enemies are wheelchair-bound and sickly. Maybe Lloyd is asleep in a hospital? Who knows. All I can say for sure is Darq\'s narrative is cryptic without delving into pretension, and I relished taking it all in for my own interpretation. crank might swap out a room for a completely different environment.\r\n\r\nYou will spend most of your time fiddling about with these lever-based puzzles, and they’re pretty enjoyable. Even the very first puzzle is a real noggin-scratcher and one I struggled with. There was a barred gate, and the only way to get past was to power up a giant mechanical contraption that was missing three cogs from its engine. So I examined the level from top to bottom, searching for the cogs in question. Simple enough. The first came easy, and the second was just gated behind a simple sliding jigsaw puzzle nearby. However, it took me far longer to figure out how to get the final cog, which was suspended from the ceiling'),

I just had to walk up the walls and onto the ceiling to grab it; it was a brilliant little eureka moment. A reminder of an essential aspect of Darq: Lloyd is inside a dream. Here, logic need not (always) apply; the fabric of this world sometimes requires manipulation to proceed. Kind of like Valve asking you to start thinking with portals in its own puzzle game, a shift in perspective is key to progression here. fire way to kill potential scares.\r\n\r\nDarq isn\'t as scary as it wants to be, and those occasionally tedious enemy encounters aren\'t solely responsible for this. While the cracked kitchen floor tiles and stained wallpaper of Lloyd\'s apartment accentuate the industrial monochromatic aesthetic, they\'re more creepy than scary. Tonally, it\'s akin to Eraserhead, David Lynch\'s 1977 surrealistic tour de force; an incredible stylistic influence, but I wouldn’t say that film is intended to be scary, either. As I guided Lloyd from dilapidated train stations to rain-slicked city streets, a low, ominous electrical hum accompanied me. Out of view, yet always present in my headphones. Unsettling? Absolutely. Scary? Not quite.Trouble is, Darq clearly wants you to be afraid of it, as is evident with its jump scares. For example, instead of just letting me breath in the air of a hauntingly beautiful stage theatre, it will periodically toss in a cheap, booming jump scare that kills the mood. Suddenly, the unsettling, dream-like vibe is ruined by loud noises. If I sneak up behind you and loudly scream, you\'re startled, not scared; and that\'s done ad nauseam here.\r\n\r\nWhile the scares miss the mark, Darq was too tantalizing a mystery for me to walk away from. My initial playthrough took about four hours to complete, with the first hour or so being inflated by the tough puzzle I mentioned earlier. Upon completion, I dove right back in to see what secrets I could discover, and the next playthrough didn\'t last 40 minutes. Once you know the puzzle solutions, you\'ll blast through the campaign with ease. But brevity is one of Darq\'s strengths. It\'s short, sweet, and loaded with little quirks and details scattered throughout that you might not notice initially. Collectible files that flesh out the story are also tucked away in each chapter, and you better bring a fine-toothed comb if you want to find them all. Thus far, I\'ve gathered a measly two files out of the seven chapters in Darq.'),
(13, 'Revisiting Crysis\'s amazing FPS sandbox: how the series lost its way', 'Why Crysis still melts the fastest gaming PCs a decade after release\r\nIt\'s time for a remaster, remake - or sequel', 'crysis1.jpg', '2019-05-15 00:00:00', 4, 'It was hard not to be completely impressed when the first images and videos of Crysis appeared about 18 months ago. Scenes of lush jungles and towering alien war machines looked light-years beyond what seemed possible. Of course, the two questions that revolved around Crysis since its announcement were whether it would deliver on those visuals and whether it would deliver a game worthy of those fancy graphics. It turns out that the answer to both those questions is a resounding yes, as Germany\'s Crytek has proven that its 2004 hit Far Cry was no fluke. In fact, it was just the beginning from this studio. With its sophomore effort, Crytek has managed to deliver an incredibly advanced and exciting first-person shooter that practically rewrites the rules for the entire genre. Crysis is an alien invasion game set in the year 2020. An archeological team on a remote Pacific island is captured by an invasion force of North Koreans, and your US Special Forces team is dispatched to investigate and rescue the scientists. Clad in high-tech nanosuits capable of boosting your strength, speed, and armor, as well as cloaking you temporarily to the enemy, you\'re parachuted into a tropical paradise that\'s crawling with intelligent enemies and something else that\'s tearing both the North Koreans and US forces to shreds.\r\n\r\nLike Far Cry, the first half of Crysis is essentially a \"sandbox\" game where you\'re put in the middle of incredibly large levels and tasked with an objective. How you get the job done is pretty much entirely up to you, which is part of the brilliance of the game\'s design. For instance, the environments are big enough to give you a wide range of latitude. Do you have to get to a certain point on the map? You can take a meandering route that avoids patrols and go stealthy, or try the up-front approach and try to blast your way through, with the danger of enemy reinforcements showing up. Need to infiltrate a North Korean-held village? You can try the front gate, or maybe explore and find a quieter way in.\r\n\r\nCouple these huge environments with the powers of the nanosuit, and you have a ton more options. You can play like the eponymous character from the movie Predator and use your cloaking abilities to stalk North Korean patrols, picking them off one by one and watching the survivors react in confusion. That could be via a silenced rifle, or simply coming up from behind a guard and grabbing him by the throat and hurling him off a cliff, or through the roof of a building, or against a tree, or whatever catches your fancy. Enhanced speed and strength give you an amazing amount of mobility, so you can vault atop buildings and come down behind someone, or run up against a North Korean vehicle next to a cliff and push it over the side. In a heartbeat you can switch between different roles, from stealthy assassin to seemingly unstoppable death dealer. It\'s a game that makes you feel like a superhero, though not an invincible one, because you simply can\'t run roughshod over the enemy. Crysis rewards smart, fast thinking. It helps that the game features a high degree of advanced physics and destructibility in a highly dynamic world. Getting caught in a firefight in the jungle is a cinematic treat, thanks to the way the bullets will chop down trees, while branches sway from impacts. This isn\'t just a visual effect, either, as falling timber can kill if it lands on someone. There\'s all sorts of emergent behavior like that throughout the game, events that spring up completely unintended or unforeseen. In one instance, the flaming wreckage of a chopper landed on a hut, crushing it and killing all those inside.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the gunplay and ballistics modeling make this shooter feel as if you\'re handling real weapons. Trying to hit a target at long engagement ranges is challenging thanks to weapon recoil and other factors. The North Koreans are encased in body armor, so they take some time to gun down, unless you aim for the head, which usually puts them on the ground. At your disposal is a variety of firearms, like shotguns and assault rifles. One of the neat aspects of the game is that you can fix up your weapons on the fly, adding scopes, silencers, and grenade launchers, provided you\'ve found them. There are trade-offs for each add-on. Silencers let you take down guys quietly, though they reduce bullet damage, meaning you\'ve got to make every shot count. Or flashlights mounted on your weapons might help you out in dark levels, but will give you away. Crysis gives you all of these toys and ratchets the action higher and higher the deeper you get into it. The first level of the game introduces you to the sandbox combat and the nanosuit. From then on, the battles become larger and more intense as the action escalates. You\'ll storm North Korean-held villages and bases; encounter their counter to your nanosuit; take part in a chaotic assault on a North Korean harbor; and from there the game accelerates. Next is a wild tank battle in a tropical mountain valley, with helicopters and jet fighters roaring overhead. There\'s a sheer rush as your tank plows through vegetation and knocks down trees as missiles and tank fire erupt all around you. Meanwhile, the vehicle explosions are convincing, right down to the way ammunition cooks off and sends spirals of smoke outward. It\'s visual poetry of destruction. You\'re not confined to your tank the entire time, either. You can jump out at any time and use your suit powers and rifle to take on enemy infantry. When they\'re dead, pick up their dropped rocket launchers and engage vehicles in a cat-and-mouse-style game.\r\n\r\nAs events in the game continue to ramp up, you\'ll find yourself inside the alien ship, the zero-gravity environment delivers a visually strange and yet wondrous setting.

Never had a game released that pushed hardware and engine technology so much, and never has one since.', 'crysis2.jpg', '2019-04-18 00:00:00', 4, 'it\'\'s been ten years since Crysis first released on PC. In 2007, it pushed real time rendering to new heights and spawned the memetic phrase, \"but can it run Crysis?\". Never had a game released that pushed hardware and engine technology so much, and never has one since. In fact, combine the latest and greatest Intel Core i7 8700K overclocked to 5.0GHz with an Nvidia Titan Xp and there\'ll still be areas of the game that drop beneath 60fps - even at 1080p. For its own very specific reasons, Crysis is still more than capable of melting the most modern, top-end PCs, but regardless, it remains a phenomenal technological achievement. It deserves a remaster at the very least, but a franchise of this standing really deserves a full next-gen sequel, with state-of-the-art rendering and back-to-basics gameplay.\r\n\r\nBut what made Crysis so groundbreaking - and perhaps so misunderstood - at the time of its release? In the video below, I play through the first level of the game, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of its rendering - and it\'s this initial stage that was our first glimpse of the game back in 2007. Crytek released a demo of this area with a full level editor, where you could spawn weapons, entities and enemies that only show up later in the game. It was a short, but comprehensive showing of all of Crysis\' systems and grandeur in one 1.8GB download.\r\n\r\nThe game started as it meant to go on. In the very first scene alone, there\'s a separable gaussian depth of field on foreground objects, soft z-feathered particles for the fog in between the alien stalactite structures, and even ray-marched volumetric lighting that is visible as the alien vessel opens up. From here we transition over to a shot of Raptor team\'s transport flying into the island and we are greeted with some subtle metallic sheen on the jet itself, and some quite gorgeous rendered volumetric clouds with permeability, back scattering, and even inner shadowing. Let\'s remember that this hails from the year 2007 of course, where most games still were relying on static skyboxes.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the  And then there was the character rendering - and bam, it\'s right in your face. At this point in time, Crytek knew that its character technology was way ahead of its contemporaries, so you get to appreciate it right away. Being a forward shading engine, Crysis uses a lot of bespoke shaders in multiple passes to achieve very specific materials. So character eyes and hair all use their own special shading model that tries to approach \"realism\". It\'s not physically-based materials like you see in modern games, but nonetheless, an attempt to give a similar effect.\r\n\r\nThis opening cut-scene also gives you a first glance at the game\'s extensive use of post-processing. Every character movement is exaggerated and weighted with a very high quality per-object motion blur, which has a great and subtle tail and rather low shutter speed, with many samples. On a high-end 8800 GTX at 1280x1024 resolution, that effect alone would consume 4ms of GPU time - a full 25 per cent of the frame-time required to hit 60fps. Suffice to say that not many PCs were going to be getting a stable 30fps at the highest settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere\'s rom there on out, the game continues to throw high-end effects at you - like the impact on the ocean itself after your parachute fails, the water caustics based upon the surface normal and with a partially volumetric effect in the water volume itself and you also see the refraction above the water surface. As you swim around you can see your own feet and arms moving about you to communicate presence. And then there\'s the beach, where you get your first interactions with objects, pushed to an almost silly degree with turtles, twigs - and even people - available to pick up. This is at a time when environmental interaction in games was telegraphed by the objects just floating in front of your character as you move.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the level of realism in most of its materials for the 2007-era time period, Crysis does not use image-based lighting from cube maps, or other types of probes, for that matter. You won\'t see glass objects with cubemap reflections in them, for example. But as a result, the only real specular lighting that really occurs is that from direct forward light sources, like the sun or any other real world lights. Only Crysis 2 and the later re-release of Crysis on consoles would take advantage of image-based lighting to increase the plasticity of indirect lighting.\r\n\r\nBy just turning around as you move up the beach head, you can admire the dedication put into subtleties of rendering in the sky and vegetation. You can see screen-space crepuscular \'god\' rays filtering through the leaves from the moon, causing a specular sheen to show on the waxy surface off the leaves, and permeating through to their back side. And edge-blend anti-aliasing system is deployed, giving an FXAA-like effect that only impacted vegetation.'),

Compared to The Witcher 2, where you\'re immediately plunged headlong into a sexy story of intrigue and betrayal, this main quest can seem mundane, even perfunctory at times.

Even ', 'thewitcher1.jpg', '2019-04-10 00:00:00', 5, 'The Witcher 3 is as dense and deep as the other two games in the series in terms of RPG mechanics, and the overwhelmingly massive open-world environment has at once made that depth more intimidating, and in the long run, more rewarding. It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing The Witcher 3’s landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever seen. A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. That a world this size still feels so purposeful, and full of things to do is quite an achievement.\r\n\r\nThe one caveat on all that though, is the technical performance on both the Xbox One and PS4 versions. 30 frames per second was sometimes too much to ask, transitions between The Witcher 3’s two main maps are just a bit too long, and minor glitches do pop up from time to time. None of it ever impacted gameplay in any meaningful way, though it did compromise the beauty of the experience ever so slightly. Thankfully, PC players can expect a lot more. On a GTX 980, Witcher 3 ran at 60 frames per second at all times on ultra settings. This new open-world map obviously has ramifications for the structure of the story, and though there are flashes of greatness, the main story is ultimately the least fulfilling part of The Witcher 3. You might call it another case of The Elder Scrolls Syndrome. Our tale begins as a multi-continent search for Geralt’s long-lost lover Yennifer, and Ciri, his surrogate daughter. My single biggest issue though, is that it never becomes much more: the overly long main story is essentially just Geralt running errands for people in exchange for information on Ciri’s whereabouts. It effectively maintains focus and momentum, but it feels more like a wild goose chase than an intriguing mystery to unravel, like the one we got in Assassins of Kings.\r\n\r\nThanks to lots of excellent dialogue and voice acting there is some emotional payoff along the way, but it’s mixed in with too much padding in the form of meaningless fetch quests and collectathons. Every time I felt like I was on the verge of an interesting revelation, I’d have to suddenly stop to escort a goat, or search for a lost, narcoleptic dwarf. Heck, even Geralt can barely hide his frustration with the constant parade of menial tasks at times.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth noting that though you will get along fine without playing the first two games in the series, without the context provided by the Witcher novels, Ciri is more or less a complete stranger until the last quarter of the journey, which made it difficult to care about finding her as much as The Witcher 3 expected me to – especially given the slew of intriguing characters who are relegated to supportive background roles.\r\nShare\r\nAutoplay setting: On\r\n\r\n\r\nThankfully, they all get chances to shine once you venture off the beaten path, and that’s where The Witcher 3 gets nearly everything incredibly right.
